# Hackathon 2023 - Group 19

**Welcome to our portfolio!**

First, we formulated our individual **learning goals**, which you can find in the **folder "goals_and_reflections"**.

To define our problem, we used several design thinking methods. First, we delevoped a **persona** and an **empathy map**, which you can find in the **folder "empathize_and_define"**. On this basis, we developed our **problem definition** by using the 5WH technique, which you can find in the same folder in the file **"Problem definition 5WH**".

We then examined our problem using a **problem tree**. You can find this in the **folder ideate**.
