# Hackathon 2023 - Group 19

**Welcome to our portfolio!**

First, we formulated our individual **learning goals**, which you can find in the folder **"goals_and_reflections"**.

To define our problem, we used several design thinking methods. First, we delevoped a **persona** and an **empathy map**, which you can find in the folder **"empathize_and_define"**. On this basis, we developed our **problem definition** by using the 5WH technique, which you can find in the same folder in the file **"Problem definition 5WH**".

We then examined our problem using a **problem tree**. You can find it in the folder **ideate**.

The next step was, to find a solution to our problem that would be implementable within our school block. After some consideration, we agreed on developing a **Google Chrome extension** with the aim of improving Moodle. The basic functions of this extension are:

- Autofilling of the enrollment key
- Marking the type of links within a course
- The ability to favorite and save individual links.

Our first prototype can be found in the **"src"** folder.
